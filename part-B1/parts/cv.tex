\begin{fundingidtable}
    DAVIS & BMBF KI4KMU & 340k€ & 2021 - 2024 & PI & Project investigates adaptive remeshing with RL. No overlap with SMARTeach.\\
    Jubot & Carl-Zeiss Foundation &  approx 250k & 2021 - 2026 & PI & Jubot investigates the use of robot learning techniques in elderly care. No overlap with SMARTeach.\\ %The imitation learning techniques developed in  this project will also help us design algorithms and skill representations for SMARTeach. Publications: CITE Vigor, Davids paper\\
    DFG FOR 5339 & DFG research group  & 600k€ & 2023 - 2027 & Co-Speaker & Develops AI methods for new production processes. No overlap with SMARTeach.\\ %It consists of six research teams from the KIT and one research team from Fraunhofer. Our lab is developing novel machine learning approaches to predict the deformations and physical properties of products throughout a stamp-forming process. This work will be the basis for learning geometric object dynamics models. Publications: CITE Jonas \\
    KiKIT & Helmholtz Pilotproject & 1 PhD student & 2023- 2025 & PI & Development of  variational inference techniques. No overlap with SMARTeach.  \\

%    Bosch  & Bosch industrial PhDs &  5 PhD students & 2020 - 2025 & Academic Supervisor  & I supervise 5 PhD students working on various topics, ranging from robotic grasping, robot vision  such as 6D pose estimation  deep reinforcement learning  and meta learning. These works provide the basis for the skill, model and perception learning techniques to be developed in SMARTeach.\\

    Circular Factory & DFG Collaborative Research Center  &  400k€ & 2024 - 2028 & PI & Develops learning techniques for robots used for remanufacturing products. No direct overlap with SMARTeach but the CRC will provide an interesting additional use case. \\

    
    RAICAM & EU MSCA Doctoral Training Program &  1 PhD scholarship & 2023 - 2026 & PI & Develops learning methods for searching and segregating objects in a heap with a mobile manipulator.  \\

IntuiLern & BMBF KI4KMU & 450k€ & 2024 - 2027 & PI & In this project, we  propose to use AR technology %for robot teaching. However, we are 
for learning industrial tasks with a small number of objects and no instructions. The main focus is on obtaining an intuitive tele-operation system for industrial robots which can be used by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). \\
